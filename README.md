# Status Checker
Status Checker can be used with cron jobs in Linux to check if your website/server is still up every x minutes and email you if it is down. You will need to create a SendGrid account and generate an API key.

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
```
npm i
```
2. Create a [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) account and generate an API key.
  - More on creating API key, [here](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/api-keys/#creating-an-api-key).
3. Set up your domain so SendGrid can send emails through your domain.
  - Instructions can be found, [here](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-domain-authentication/).
4. Create a `.env` file in root directory of this project
5. Inside the newly created `.env` file add the following:
  - `SENDGRID_API_KEY` - your SendGrid API key SendGrid API key
  - `recipients` - the email addresses you want alerted (comma separated)
  - `sender` - the address from which the emails will be sent from
  - `url` - the url that you want to checl

  ```
  SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your_api_key
  recipients=person1@example.com,person2@example.com
  sender=something@your_domain.com
  url=https://www.example.com
  ```
6. Run `node ./src/index.js`
  - This part can be automated with a cron job.
